# Healthcare_Readmission_Prediction

As a general goal for the US healthcare system, reducing per capita cost without compromising patient or population health and quality of care is of the utmost importance. The issue of readmission opens up an avenue for potential cost reduction and highlights the need for collaboration between the government and hospitals. In the past, these two organizations have worked against each other towards a common goal, but not in coordination. The solution is twofold: firstly, data driven models must be at the forefront of decision making, and secondly, hospitals as a business must buy into the idea that it is best to move from fee-for-service to value-based care in order to achieve the goal of optimal communal health. It is empirical to look into the drivers of readmission and act proactively, rather than after the readmission has occurred. In this project, we utilized machine learning methods such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Confusion Matrix, KNN and Random Forest to help predict which patients are likely to readmit. This information will be used to reduce cost while prioritizing value-based patient care.
